# Guess Game Project ðŸŽ®

This project contains multiple versions of a simple **number guessing game** built using the **Jac language**.

## ðŸ§  Overview
The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number randomly generated by the program.

Each version improves on the previous one:
- **guess_game1.jac** â†’ Basic number guessing
- **guess_game2.jac** â†’ Adds input validation
- **guess_game3.impl.jac / guess_game3.jac** â†’ Introduces class-based structure
- **guess_game4â€“6** â†’ Enhanced logic and modular code

## ðŸš€ How to Run
Make sure you have [Jac](https://jac-lang.org/) installed, then run any version like this:

```bash
jac run guess_game5.jac
